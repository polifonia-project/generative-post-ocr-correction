2290	These are wise remarks, written, he it ob served, not at all in reference to recent events, hut to illustrate a criticism on the Viceroyalties of Hardinge and Dalhousie. If it be remarked that the Hindoos are also fanatical, and that their fanaticism did not pre vent their comparatively easy subjugation in the first instance, and their not difficult retention in a state of quietude afterwards, the answer is, that their fanaticism is of quite a different kind to that now spoken of, and has scarcely any perceptible reference to political domination, therein varying altogether from the Sikhs, and scarcely less from the Mussulmans. Religion is so entirely mixed up and interwoven in the Hindoo nature that it is part and parcel of his social being and you could no more dissever him from his religion, and yet preserve his social status, than you could change his skin-a fact almost entirely lost sight of by those whose judgment is impaired by their commendable anxiety to see a pure faith supersede a foul one.
